# Introduction
This data repository includes large-scale performance data of Hadoop and Spark applications on Alibaba Cloud, HUAWEI Cloud, Tencent Cloud and UCloud. Since performance varies with different inputs, our data includes multiple combinations of applications and inputs. We use workload to describe an application and its input. The workloads are extracted from HiBench.

## Workloads
For each application, we use four different inputsâ€”either data inputs or input parameters. Since some workloads cannot complete on some of the VM types, we totally have about 50 workloads with full performance data on 55 VM types.
